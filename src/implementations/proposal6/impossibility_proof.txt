Certified Precision Impossibility Proof
========================================

Scenario 1: Feed-Forward Network
  Curvature: 0
  Required precision: 9 bits
  INT8 status: UNSAFE

Scenario 2: Long-Context Attention (8192 tokens)
  Curvature: 4.43089e+06
  Required precision: 43 bits
  INT8 status: IMPOSSIBLE (mathematically proven)

Scenario 3: Ill-Conditioned Matrix Inversion (κ = 1e12)
  Curvature: 2e+36
  Required precision: 157 bits
  FP64 status: INSUFFICIENT (> 52 bits required)

These bounds are derived from Theorem 5.7 in hnf_paper.tex
and represent fundamental mathematical limits.
